#### Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:


Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

Character type:


Special characters
Numeric characters
Lowercase characters
Uppercase characters




The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

The user will also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.

Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
